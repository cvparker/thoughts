I already posted some thoughts on using Sculpt OS on Mac Mini. Here is a little bit about my efforts to port the HelenOS driver (https://github.com/HelenOS/helenos) for the AR9271 USB wlan dongle from Atheros.

First, without going into all the details, let me just say that there were a few challenges even getting the AR9271 to work under HelenOS itself. These involve issues that are probably specific to HelenOS, for example the XHCI driver had some bugs, there were a few other bugs outside the driver itself, etc. But I did get it working, although stress testing is not something I was able to do well - I don't know how to get tools in HelenOS that can load recent version of HTTP, so I was confined to pulling small webpages, such as from my wifi network's router.

So from there, the conceptual path to porting to Sculpt was straightforward. However, HelenOS is written in C, Sculpt in C++. HelenOS also has it's own set of abstractions, and I decided I didn't want to try to emulate a HelenOS environment. But as another microkernel OS, the code for AR9271 is nicely separated from the rest of HelenOS, making the port pretty easy conceptually. The approach I opted for was to be pretty brutal to the code, however. C sructures were converted to C++ classes, and functions that logically operated on them (e.g. first argument is a struct whatever *) were added as members. A lot of that was syntax, and it took me a bit since I haven't done a lot of C++, especially the recent features (which are awesome, BTW - override keyword FTW). The code ended up hacky and has no consistent style. But it kind of worked.

There's also a bunch of tricks to play in Sculpt to get the manager to actually connect the Wifi - but nothing too hard.

Next came the difficult part - the HW just froze after a while. So, I resorted to packet-sniffing the USB connection to determine where the differences between the ported HelenOS driver under Sculpt, and the Linux driver lay. It turned out there were a few things.
